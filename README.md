# BrickBreaker

Hello! This is my first hand at testing out a BrickBreaker game that I've worked in the past Summer! Here you should be able to use the Java file to play a Java based game! As my first branch, please report any issues and bugs with the code below! 

Thank you, and I hope you enjoy this small project!
